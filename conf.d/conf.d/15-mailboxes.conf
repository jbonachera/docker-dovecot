  #  auto=subscribe

  #  special_use = \Junk
  #  auto=subscribe

  #mailbox "Deleted Items" {
  #  special_use = \Trash
  #  auto=subscribe

  # For \Sent mailboxes there are two widely used names. We'll mark both of
  # them as \Sent. User typically deletes one of them if duplicates are created.
  #mailbox "Sent Items" {
  #  special_use = \Sent
